So a strange thing happened today. I member of a Discord server that I only ended up joining due to sheer coincidence posted a joke about people who don't have a Twitter
account being happier. I made a joke about only having one because of an old class I had in high school, which made me think all about it again. I joked about how I could rant
but won't, only for the same person to ask about it. So, I unloaded everything about how I took a class at a technical college that was supposed to be "Video Game Design",
and was described as teaching how to code, yet of the two years I was there, I basically did anything but. As chance would have it, that same person was part of an open-source
project, and asked if I was still intersted in learning. I was directed to GitHub, and now I sit here typing all this up as part of their tutorials. Maybe this opportunity,
that dropped on me by sheer happenstance, will open the door to something. I don't fully know what, but the door may be opened.
